# Flickpick


## Current Development of Flickpick

This is merely a barebones version of the app. It has a lot to gain from improvements I plan to implement as a personal project.

### Unimplemented/Incomplete Elements of Flickpick

+ Only returns movies based on release year, no interaction with genre.
+ Never implemented Google Sign-in


## Third Party Libraries

+ [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) (includes OkHttp and Retrofit)

  Retrofit is designed to establish and perform requests to WikiSky API web service.
  

+ [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)
    
    Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.


### Goals

+Improve UI
+Implement features I never got to add

### User Interface Improvements

+ Display category items and clickable items from dashboard.
+ Make sure captured star image displays full screen.
+ Implement fiction using camera as a way to let users see where they are pointing their phone.
