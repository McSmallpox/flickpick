Upon clicking "Next," Intellij will bring up a window in which you may further configure your import settings, but most of these can be left on their defaults (as shown in the below screenshot).

You'll be asked if you'd like to overwrite the existing file. Click "Yes."

The program will open and the Gradle will start building.
