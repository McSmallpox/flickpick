1. As a casual moviegoer, I don't have time to sift through pages and pages online just to find a perfect movie to watch on a Saturday night.
But thanks to Flickpick, I don't have to worry about it anymore, as it will go through thousands of IMDb pages for me and find exactly what I was looking for.

2. As a hardcore cinephile, it can be hard to find films I haven't seen before. After trying Flickpick, however, I've been able to find fresh, obscure films that not even Sundance has heard of.
No more indecision when it comes to my choice of film.
